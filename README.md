# DZmix

DZmix.exe is for use on Windows and requires a free compiler available here: https://www.mathworks.com/supportfiles/downloads/R2014a/deployment_files/R2014a/installers/win64/MCR_R2014a_win64_installer.exe

MATLAB .m and .fig files for running DZmix graphical user interface (GUI) directly in MATLAB does not require the MATLAB MCR compiler. 

Sundell_Saylor_2017_Inverse_unmixing_model_v_1_1_02.m is a simplified code also for use directly in MATLAB, but does not have a graphical user interface (GUI). Instructions are annotated in the code.
