# DZmix (Sundell and Saylor, 2017)

# Run in MATLAB

To run DZmix in MATLAB open the DZmix.m file and run it.

Sundell_Saylor_2017_Inverse_unmixing_model_v_1_1_02.m is a simplified code also for use directly in MATLAB, but does not have a graphical user interface (GUI). Instructions are annotated in the code.

# Run without MATLAB

DZmix can be run in MATLAB or as a standalone .exe file (Windows) or .app file (macOS) that can be used without having a copy MATLAB. The file can be run from your computer's Desktop, or wherever you choose to keep it.

To run as a standalone program DZmix requires the free MATLAB Runtime Compiler 2018b version 9.5. There are separate compilers for macOS and Windows. Install the compiler first, then run the .exe (Windows) or .app (macOS).

Here are the links for the compilers (click to start download). Follow all of the default settings to install. Nothing will happen following installation -- there is no need to open the compiler -- DZmix will access it automatically.
